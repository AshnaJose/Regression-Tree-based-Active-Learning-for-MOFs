# Regression Tree-based Active Learning for MOFs

# Overview

Regression Tree-based Active Learing (RT-AL) is a pool-based active learning method that uses the partitions given by regression trees to sample informative samples in the training set.

The file RT-AL.py (which uses regression_tree.py and var.py) can be used for any given dataset of MOFs, with a descriptor of choice and target property of interest. A comprehensive example on how to use the code is provided in the folder Examples, for a benchmark MOF dataset.
